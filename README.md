## Day Planner

The goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  Moment.js library was used to work with date and time. 


### How it works:

- When the user opens the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

- Timeblocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm) are displayed when the user scrolls down

- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

- When the user clicks into a timeblock they can enter an event and click the save button

- After the user clicks save, the event will be saved and will still be there when the webpage is refreshed
